5.0 |name american_airlines |country united_states |cabin first_class |review this is a rough review because we flew first business and coach we usually fly coach but for a trip to napa we used our points to go first class the aa united merger combined the worst two airlines in the western world flew on 4 7 260 193 ban dfx san service food seating excellent plane a little old and shaky but all in all a good flight returned 4 13 193 5290 san charlotte bna although we had first class we were relegated to business with an accompanying drop in quality across the board the trouble is the age of the planes it s like something from a museum the noise from the engine was so loud it was like sticking your head under the hood of a car but for once all flights left on time without mechanical problems we were closer to the real world of 95 of all travelers with tasteless food a box handed out at the end of a 6 hour flight with a roll candy bar and smoothy entertainment quote unquote was from attached dirty ancient screens for which aa would kindly sell earphones i had my ipad and kept busy while the mrs tried to doze then at charlotte it s reality time we got bumped to economy first row but the constant groans reminded us that these seats were once used for unruly reform school students that was in the 1940 s since they were tiny dirty torn and stretched the place looked filthy a webbed shower curtain in several pieces separated first class real classy but they did manage to pass drinks to us in the cattle car yes we are switching carriers to anyone who has bought a plane in the last 30 years
1.0 |name flybe |country united_kingdom |cabin economy |review am thoroughly fed up with flybe customer services my wife and i checked into the flybe desk at faro on the 29th september for the return trip to exeter despite the fact that we had pre booked our seats paying the new economy flight tariff we were told the aircraft was too full to allow us to sit together i complained to flybe customer services yet i have not even received the courtesy of an acknowledgement both outbound and inbound flights were also an hour late on departure
5.0 |name american_airlines |country united_arab_emirates |cabin economy |review i have flown mia jfk on an old b767 300 flight was full seat very old but comfortable and pitch was ok entertainment only through overhead screens i was shocked that this aircraft had the new hatrack design only for premium cabins economy cabin still had the 90 s hatrack design which a looks very old and b does not have enough room for everyone only non alcoholic drink service for this 2hr flight staff very unprofessional there seems to be an inconsistency in their uniform one female flight attendant was wearing what seemed to be her personal apron that featured dozens of us flags next to each other after landing in jfk we had to hold at a remote stand before our gate was available as usual passengesr were standing up and retrieving their bags from the overhead bins despite the captain making an announcement to remain seated no flight attendant took any action only a captain in american airlines uniform travelling as a passenger made assertive requests for everyone to remain seated to which everyone then complied also saw a male flight attendant making a call on his mobile phone during taxiing to the gate very unprofessional
7.0 |name china_southern_airlines |country australia |cabin economy |review taipei to guilin 1 may the service was quite good as was the meal although it was quite small there was no ife which was a pity for an international flight of nearly 2 hours the 737 was new and well maintained
4.0 |name air_canada |country czech_republic |cabin economy |review not entirely certain why air canada calls itself a legacy carrier flew new york newark to vancouver and then later on to los angeles payment for checked in luggage on an international flight is unacceptable offering no food only for purchase for a 6 flight is unacceptable ground male staff in vancouver flight to lax was extremely rude and arrogant to most passengers including an elderly gentleman who was confused about payment for luggage planes are spotless and its a complete shame since the onboard crew were simply perfect with their service as well as attention to security far superior to any us airline i used in the last 3 weeks on my usa canada tour no value for money for sure my future flights will be take in asian european carriers to ensure the full service that is expected as a standard
8.0 |name lan_airlines |country new_zealand |cabin economy |review economy from wellington to akl scl lim cusco return flights were on time lanes modern and well maintained seats comfortable onboard personnel friendly and helpful the only problem was the nz part of the trip lan was let down by its codeshare agreement with qantas who book domestic flights on the budget airline jetstar our jetstar flight outbound was delayed and the return was cancelled we were unable to check luggage through and had to carry our suitcases from domestic to international terminal and back jetstar refused to hear our complaint and qantas refused it became our problem and our extra cost to buy an air new zealand ticket to ensure we made our flight plan qantas does not honour the codeshare agreement with lan and fails to provide adequate customer service this is unfortunate because unlike qantas lan provides a high quality service at an acceptable cost
8.0 |name turkish_airlines |country united_kingdom |cabin economy |review chose the airline due to recommendation and price went from gatwick to kuala lumpur via istanbul experienced a long delay on the outward leg at istanbul but otherwise flights were on time staff were very attentive and the food was excellent when transferring flights at istanbul on the return leg queues were dreadful requiring us to go through security again this needs to be sorted out however would certainly use them again as overall the level of service was extremely high
5.0 |name malaysia_airlines |country australia |cabin business_class |review i flew from amsterdam to kuala lumpur then onto melbourne i was a little disappointed with the flights the seat on the flight from amsterdam to kuala lumpur was the worst ever i ended up with a really sore back there was not much of a selection for tv entertainment the service was good and i enjoyed the satay the most the cabins could do with a really good clean i would not use them again unless i hear that the seats have improved
