On the way back from Cuba on March 12th 2014 WG 631 we were slow going through immigration no fault of Sunwing. Finally arrived to our plane at 10.35am the doors immediately closed and the plane took off 5 minutes later 20 minutes earlier than expected. The 6 of us were pretty much split up by 2 each seating my 12 old daughter by herself behind us. Overall the staff were great very friendly and approachable. The food served was pretty good considering most airlines don't offer meal service for free. It was comparable to meals we've had to purchase on other airlines.\",\n",

      "1.0 |name sunwing_airlines |country canada |cabin economy |review my wife and i spent a great deal of time and research finding a vacation to the mayan riviera that left vancouver at an appropriate time to fit with our schedule we chose a sunwing flight with a 10am departure and a direct flight to cancun with a 6pm return direct to vancouver a week later we paid extra to get elite plus extra baggage weight extra legroom etc if you decide to pay this premium do not sit in the bulkhead seats there is no more legroom to stretch out and your carry on will have to be stowed somewhere far behind you as there is not space in front of you the exit rows are really good for legroom and convenience our flight was rescheduled with no warning to a 7am departure with a stop in calgary on the way so we had to leave home at 3 in the morning to catch the plane on the return we were rescheduled to make a stop in calgary before coming to vancouver these stops added 2 5 hours to our flight to cancun and 3 5 hours to our flight home as weather and a crew change delayed departure from calgary sunwing did not apologize or say anything about the rescheduling there were about 80 passengers from vancouver and we picked up less than 20 in calgary so sunwing alienated 80 of its passengers to pick up a few folks the planes both ways were only partially full so it is obvious that this total disregard for customers is seriously affecting their business on a positive note the cabin crews were excellent both ways even though they too had been seriously disrupted by the schedule and routing changes i will certainly never fly with sunwing again \r\n",
