Outbound: Used the Oryx lounge at Doha airport which was nice. Cabin was nearly empty. Seats are similar to those on Jet's domestic business class. Found it difficult to sleep with the recline provided. At 6'3\" legrests did not help as my legs overshot it. The light sandwich was passable. Service was attentive and cheerful. Inbound: Evening flight so looked forward to meal and wine. Same cheap French table wine. Indian non-veg meal was not great. Cabin crew were attentive and friendly. IFE was limited. One negative was that my bag was one of the last off both flights with a priority tag.\n",
       "2     5.0  This is a rough review because we flew first business and coach. We usually fly coach but for a trip to Napa we used our points to go first class. The AA/United merger combined the worst two airlines in the Western world. Flew on 4/7 (260 / 193) - BAN-DFX-SAN. Service food seating excellent. Plane a little old and shaky but all in all a good flight. Returned 4/13 (193/5290) SAN-Charlotte-BNA. Although we had first class we were relegated to business with an accompanying drop in quality across the board. The trouble is the age of the planes - it's like something from a museum. The noise from the engine was so loud it was like sticking your head under the hood of a car. But for once all flights left on time without mechanical problems. We were closer to the real world of 95% of all trave...\n",

My wife and I checked into the Flybe desk at Faro on the 29th September for the return trip to Exeter. Despite the fact that we had pre-booked our seats paying the New Economy Flight tariff we were told the aircraft was too full to allow us to sit together. I complained to Flybe customer services yet I have not even received the courtesy of an acknowledgement. Both outbound and inbound flights were also an hour late on departure.\n",
       "4     5.0  I have flown MIA-JFK on an old B767-300. Flight was full. Seat very old but comfortable and pitch was ok. Entertainment only through overhead screens. I was shocked that this aircraft had the new hatrack design only for premium cabins Economy cabin still had the 90's hatrack design which a) looks very old and b) does not have enough room for everyone. Only non-alcoholic drink service for this 2hr flight. Staff very unprofessional. There seems to be an inconsistency in their uniform. One female flight attendant was wearing - what seemed to be her personal apron that featured dozens of US flags next to each other. After landing in JFK we had to hold at a remote stand before our gate was available. As usual passengesr were standing up and retrieving their bags from the overhead bins despi..."
