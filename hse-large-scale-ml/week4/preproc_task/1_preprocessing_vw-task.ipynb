       "3  My fiancé and I were booked to fly to Cayo Santa Maria (CUBA) February 6-13 2014. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 6.10am. Upon arriving at the airport at 4.30am we quickly noticed that the line up was very long. When we finally got to the check-in desk they asked us where we were headed we replied Cayo Santa Maria. We advised her that we had checked in online already and we just needed to print our boarding passes. She took our baggage and weighed it. Right before she was about to send it off a rude manager from the back came and just yelled out \"gates to Santa Clara are closed\". We were so shocked because it was only 4.55am at that time. We told them the plane would just be sitting there we could still make it.
